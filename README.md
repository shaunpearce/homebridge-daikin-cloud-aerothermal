## Plugin settings

- you can disable on/off function
- you can disable hot water tank accessory (may be needed, if you don't own hot water tank device)
- you can disable outdoor temperature settings (may be needed, if you don't own hot water tank device)

## Limitations

Daikin doesn't provide target Heater/Cooler temperature. So the temperature shown in this accessory is current leaving water temperature & target temperature is offset.

Current acessory state doesnt reflect if your device is idle/heating/cooling, because daikin doesn't provide this information (we only know the target state).

Even if you set "Disable on/off switch", you are still able to switch devices on/off in homebridge accessory page (it works fine in ios home).

## Install

Install from NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-daikin-heatpump-cloud

## Config

Add config object to the platform array in your Homebridge `config.json`.

```
{
    "bridge": {
        ...
    },
    "accessories": [],
    "platforms": [
        {
            "username": "<username>",
            "password": "<password>",
            "platform": "DaikinCloudAerothermal",
            "HotWaterTank": false, // true or false (boolean), default: false
            "OutdoorTemperature": true, // true or false (boolean), default: true
            "DisableOnOff": false //  true or false (boolean), default false
        }
    ]
}
```
